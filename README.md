# FourierPhysics3
Fourier_Func.py takes an arbitrary one dimensional function and creates a Fourier series to model it. 


main.py allows the user to draw a function of 1 variable on the x-y plane and reconstructs it using a Fourier Series


Drawing.py takes an SVG file as input and redraws it using a Fourier Series on the complex plane. 
*NOTE: SVG input must be a wholly-connected image. Gaps in the image will result in undefined behavior


Further details can be found in Drawing_with_Fourier_Series.pdf
