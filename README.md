# FourierPhysics3
Fourier_Func.py takes an arbitrary one dimensional function and creates a Fourier series to model it. 



Drawing.py takes an SVG file as input and redraws it using a Fourier Series on the complex plane. 
*NOTE: SVG input must be a wholly-connected image. Gaps in the image will result in undefined behavior
